Collection of personal projects that happen to focus on machine learning and image processing.

All code, unless otherwise noted, done by Sandra Carrico:

BayAreaFresh/automation/mac:
  Python and various helper scripts for capturing data from websites by driving chrome.
  The current version uses applescript.  A small amount of refactoring could customize the 
  python class to use other browsers like phanthomJS.  Applescript has its advantages in 
  specialized instances, which is why I implemented it that way.
  
  Site specific code is not controlled here for privacy reasons.
  
BayAreaFresh/imageprocessing:
  Generally used to collect or extract data from images.  That data may be used as inputs
  to machine learning algorithms elsewhere.
  
See BayAreaFresh/imageprocessing/createEnv.sh for how to install OpenCV with python 3.6.
